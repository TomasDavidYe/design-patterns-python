## About
In this package, you will find a list of object oriented design patterns and utilities that I have found particularly useful.
Each project here comes with an article about how to use it and code examples in Python.


## List of Patterns

### 1) Template Method Pattern
Are you a Python developer who finds themselves copy-pasting the same code over and over again and then changing it slightly to get a different function?

If so, then this pattern is for you.

### 2) Automated Screenshots to URL Workflow
Are you using your computer for professional endeavours? Do you take screenshots of your work regularly and share them with others via URL in Markdown documents? Finally, are you sick of the tedious process it takes to go from taking a screenshot to uploading it to an image hosting service to get a shareable URL?

If so, let me present to you how you can make your screenshot-sharing process fast and effortless with a little bit of Python code.
